The offer per share is $6, including $5 per share in cash and $1 per share in Community Health's common stock. The cash portion of the consideration would be financed with available cash on hand along with external debt financing.

Community Health does not expect the transaction requires approval by Community Health shareholders and the transaction would not result in antitrust issues. The offer was rejected by Tenet's Board of Directors due to many factors on December 6, 2010. According to Tenet's Board, the Community Health proposal undervalues Tenet, Community Health’s stock appears to be over-valued, Community Health’s willingness to operate with excessive leverage creates an overhang on the stock, Community Health is ill-prepared to integrate and operate Tenet and Community Health appears not to understand, and is unable to meet, the obligations under Tenet’s Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

Community Health Systems, Inc. reiterated its offer to acquire Tenet Healthcare Corp. on December 6, 2010. The offer per share remains the same and is made directly to the Tenet Healthcare shareholders. The deal was unanimously approved by the Community Health’s Board of Directors. The acquisition of Tenet is expected to be accretive to Community Health’s earnings per share in the first full year after closing, excluding one-time costs. On January 7, 2011, Tenet Healthcare has adopted poison pill to avoid the merger. Under this, if any person or firm buys more than 4.9% of Tenet's stock, shareholders who own less than 4.9% of the Tenet Healthcare's stock will get the right to buy one additional share for every share they own. The measure will take effect January 17, 2011.

On April 18, 2011, Community Health Systems made a revised offer to acquire Tenet Healthcare for $2.9 billion in cash. Under the terms of the revised offer, Community Health Systems will pay $6 per share in cash. The Board of Tenet Healthcare rejected the revised offer on the ground of inadequate offer price which under values Tenet Healthcare. On May 2, 2011, Community Health Systems made a revised offer to acquire Tenet Healthcare for $3.5 billion in cash. Under the terms of the revised offer, Community Health Systems will pay $7.25 per share in cash. The increased offer will expire and CHS will withdraw its nominees for election to Tenet’s Board of Directors in the event Tenet does not enter into good-faith discussions with Community Health Systems by May 9, 2011. The offer was rejected by Tenet's Board of Directors on May 9, 2011. The offer grossly undervalues Tenet and is not in the best interests of Tenet or its shareholders.
