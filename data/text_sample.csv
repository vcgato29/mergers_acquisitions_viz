Jul-15-2014,Lawsuits & Legal Issues,Health Management Associates Inc.,The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida Dismisses Securities Fraud Class Action Brought Against Health Management Associates,"The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida dismissed a securities fraud class action brought against Health Management Associates Inc. from statements allegedly made to conceal Medicare fraud. Shareholders in Health Management Associates Inc. (HMA), a hospital operator, sued the company and three of its executives, alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, arising from misstatements made to conceal a purported scheme to defraud Medicare, which resulted in inflated revenue during the class period. The complaint alleged the defendants crafted a corporate policy that mandated the admission of Medicare patients to HMA hospitals, even when unnecessary, in order to artificially boost the firm's financial results. When corrective disclosures were made to the market, the firm's stock price declined, to the plaintiffs' material detriment. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The district court noted that in order to constitute a corrective disclosure, the disclosure must reveal to the market the falsity of a prior misstatement. Here, the corrective disclosures identified by the complaint in each case represented information indicating the possibility that HMA was engaged in Medicare fraud, but not the demonstration of the actual falsity of any challenged misrepresentation. Although the plaintiffs identified the Aug. 3, 2011, disclosure of government subpoenas relating to the alleged scheme and analyst downgrades following that disclosure, the court found that based on applicable precedent, the revelation of an investigation, standing alone, did not reveal any actual wrongdoing and, therefore, did not qualify as a corrective disclosure. The court similarly rejected the plaintiffs' contention that a market analyst's report informing the market of the details of an underlying action against HMA relating to the alleged scheme did not qualify as a corrective disclosure. The report merely summarized information already available to the public and, as a result, also could not qualify as a corrective disclosure. As a result, although HMA's stock price fell following those and other identified disclosures, that by itself was not sufficient to establish the disclosures were corrective of fraudulent misstatements that artificially inflated the firm's stock price prior to the disclosures. Accordingly, and after finding the complaint did not identify a disclosure that demonstrated the actual falsity of any challenged misrepresentation, the court concluded the complaint failed to adequately plead loss causation. The district court therefore granted the defendants' motion to dismiss.",Other
Jul-11-2014,Lawsuits & Legal Issues,CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE:CVS),Claims Against CVS Caremark Corp Arising from Dispensing of Generic Drugs Dismissed,"Claims against CVS Caremark Corp. arising from dispensing of generic drugs dismissed. The Michigan Supreme Court reversed a court of appeals judgment and reinstated a trial court's judgment on the pleadings in favor of pharmacy operator defendants in a qui tam action brought by a state government arising from the defendants' retention of savings obtained by dispensing generic drugs in place of brand-name equivalents. Marcia Gurganus brought a qui tam action in the name of the state of Michigan against CVS Caremark Corp. and numerous other pharmacy operators, alleging the defendants violated a state statute by improperly retaining savings that should have been passed on to customers when dispensing generic drugs in the place of their brand-name equivalents. Under the statute, when a pharmacist receives a prescription for a brand-name drug and instead dispenses the generic equivalent, the pharmacist must ""pass on the savings in cost to the purchaser. After similar actions were consolidated, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed, and the court of appeals reversed. The supreme court then granted certiorari. The supreme court found the complaints failed to plead facts with sufficient particularity to survive summary judgment. The plaintiffs attempted to derive the wholesale costs of drugs dispensed by all the Michigan defendants by extrapolating from the wholesale costs in a single set of proprietary data from a single Kroger pharmacy in West Virginia. The supreme court held the inferences and assumptions required to implicate the defendants, based on the limited data presented, were simply too tenuous to support the plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs' overbroad approach in identifying all transactions in which a generic drug was dispensed failed to focus on the only relevant transactions, namely those involving the dispensing of a generic drug in place of a brand-name drug. That overbroad pleading method was deficient, particularly given the plaintiffs' burden to plead instances of fraud with particularity. The supreme court further held the plaintiffs' claims under the Health Care False Claims Act (HCFCA) and the Medicaid False Claims Act (MFCA) were derivative of their claims under the state statute at issue and, as a result, were also subject to dismissal. Accordingly, the supreme court reversed the court of appeals' judgment and reinstated the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.",GlobeNewswire

The Company has submitted these findings to the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as part of a request for expanded coverage for the WalkAide. The clinical trial proved that the WalkAide is equivalent to the current standard of care, the Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) conventional brace, for improvements in gait speed and stroke related quality of life measures. Additionally, results from this trial support the fact that use of the WalkAide produces statistically significant and clinically-relevant improvements in several aspects of subjects' functional mobility and should be considered a viable alternative to conventional bracing for individuals with foot drop caused by chronic stroke. Titled The Effects of Peroneal Nerve Functional Electrical Stimulation versus Ankle-Foot Orthosis in Patients with Chronic Stroke: a Randomized Controlled Trial, the INSTRIDE multi-center randomized controlled trial was designed to compare changes in gait and quality of life of individuals who wear the WalkAide versus those wearing an AFO. All 495 trial participants were chronic stroke patients who were at least six months post-stroke and suffered from a form of lower leg paralysis or weakness known as foot drop. Granted 510(k) clearance by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005 and a CE Mark from the European Union in 2006, the WalkAide is an external stimulator that applies electrical pulses to restore proper foot flexion for patients who have experienced a stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, or cerebral palsy. The device functions by using a microprocessor with a built-in tilt sensor that allows for precise timing of stimulus to create a normalized gait pattern. About the size of a deck of cards, the device fits on a small cuff worn around the calf; it has no external wires and can be worn with or without shoes. Developed and commercialized by Hanger's business unit Innovative Neurotronics, Inc., the WalkAide is currently being used by thousands of patients worldwide.",PR Newswire

Announces a Comprehensive Infection Prevention Study","HCA Holdings, Inc. announced a comprehensive infection prevention study, conducted exclusively at 43 HCA-affiliated hospitals, has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study, known as Randomized Evaluation of Decolonization Versus Universal Clearance to Eliminate (REDUCE) MRSA, was conducted in conjunction with investigators at Harvard and several other academic institutions, and research programs at two U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agencies, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The use of antimicrobial agents on an entire patient population is referred to as universal decolonization. The study found that using antimicrobial soap and ointment to decolonize all intensive care unit patients reduces all bloodstream infections, including MRSA by 44%. The findings suggest a major change in healthcare practice that could save lives. As a result of the findings, HCA is in the process of implementing universal decolonization in its adult intensive care units at its affiliated hospitals. The study, which involved nearly 75,000 patients and more than 280,000 patient days in 74 adult ICUs located in 16 states, compared the results of three approaches in ICUs: Screen all patients and isolate MRSA carriers; Targeted decolonization: screening, isolation, and decolonization of MRSA carriers with chlorhexidine and mupirocin ointment; Universal decolonization: no screening and all patients decolonized with chlorhexidine and nasal mupirocin ointment.",Business Wire

In addition to tools such as Refill by Scan, Walgreens pharmacists can significantly improve adherence to medications through face-to-face interaction and counseling. One recent study demonstrated a nearly 5% increase in adherence rates among patients who received regular counseling from their pharmacist over the course of a year. The Walgreens Prescription API marks the first time such technology is available for adoption among mobile app developers who focus on health and wellness, and it is the second API program offered by Walgreens. Last year, Walgreens launched its QuickPrints SDK and API, which provided third-party developers with the ability to integrate in-store photo services for its users. The Walgreens Prescription API has been adopted by several app developers including Healthspek and PocketPharmacist.",Other

Sep-17-2012,Strategic Alliances,Walgreen Co. (NYSE:WAG),Walgreen Co. Teams with Rx Response on Readiness Program,"Walgreen Co. and Rx Response announced a new health care collaboration developed to help ensure patient access to medications following a natural disaster. The relationship centers around the Rx Response Pharmacy Status Reporting Tool (PSRT) and enhancements made to the tool as a result of the Rx Response-Walgreens relationship. The PSRT is an online program that allows emergency managers and the public to readily locate open pharmacies in communities that have been impacted by severe weather or other events. The tool was first developed by Rx Response in 2009. In partnership with the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP), Emdeon/eRx, and Relay Health, the PSRT monitors electronic billing transmissions from pharmacies to insurance processing companies. When a pharmacy is transmitting electronic billing data, it is presumed open and Rx Response posts the pharmacy's location on an interactive map on the Rx Response website. An enhanced version of the PSRT has been created due to the collaborative relationship between Walgreens and Rx Response. Walgreens becomes the first U.S. pharmacy chain to provide status reports on its pharmacies directly to Rx Response, to help ensure more timely reporting on Walgreens stores able to help serve impacted communities. The tool was most recently deployed in response to Hurricane Isaac and its enhanced capabilities provided federal, state and local emergency management officials with valuable assistance in the days following the hurricane. Rx Response developed the PSRT when it recognized that state and local emergency managers struggled to report on the availability of health care services during and after emergencies. Rx Response was able to address this challenge by providing quick and reliable insight into the operating status of pharmacies in disaster-affected areas through its PSRT. The Walgreens-Rx Response relationship is one of several key initiatives Walgreens has implemented in recent years to strengthen its disaster relief efforts to better serve customers in impacted communities. Earlier this year, Walgreens established its Security Operations Center (SOC), located in Deerfield, Ill. The SOC is available 24/7 to assist Walgreens team members with incidents that can affect operations. The SOC has provided Walgreens with improved situational awareness and enhanced capabilities to monitor severe weather and other events that may disrupt business operations. This new capability proved instrumental earlier this year as Colorado battled widespread wildfires. Staff in the SOC were able to monitor the path of the wildfires and communicate with stores potentially impacted by the fires to provide emergency response support. This included instructions on emergency closings for pharmacies and how to expedite the ordering of emergency supplies.",PR Newswire

Non-adherence is an especially important issue for high cholesterol patients, as it places them at a greater risk of complications from heart disease. The study, titled The impact of pharmacist face-to-face counseling to improve medication adherence among patients initiating statin therapy, was published in April in the online journal, Patient Preference and Adherence. To conduct the study, a group of more than 2,000 patients new to statin therapy were followed for 12 months. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, the intervention group consisted of 586 patients, and the comparison group comprised 516 patients. Pharmacists trained in brief motivational interviewing conducted counseling sessions that addressed barriers to adherence for statin patients, such as perceptions of the value of the therapy, fear of side effects and simple forgetfulness or establishing a routine to take medication. Outcomes were measured using three metrics evaluating adherence: continuous medication possession ratio (MPR), categorical MPR and medication persistency. The study found that at 12 months the intervention group had significantly greater adherence than the comparison group. The intervention group had an average adherence of 61.8% and the comparison group had 56.9% (a 4.9% point improvement); 40.9% of the intervention group and only 33.7% of comparison group achieved the clinically important 80% adherence (a 7.2% point improvement); 43.9% of the intervention group and 38.2% of comparison group continued taking their statin medication (a 5.7% point improvement).",SEC Form 8k

Nov-09-2011,Product-Related Announcements,CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE:CVS),CVS Caremark Corporation Launches Pharmacy Advisor for Chronic Cardiovascular Care,"CVS Caremark Corporation has launched Pharmacy Advisor for chronic cardiovascular care, a pharmacy-based approach to managing one of the most prevalent and expensive chronic illnesses. The program, which combines pharmacy benefit management (PBM) insights and solutions with pharmacist interventions, ensures that patients follow their medication regimens to achieve optimal health outcomes. Pharmacy Advisor(TM) for chronic cardiovascular care will initially focus on improving medication adherence for four conditions: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure. High blood pressure alone affects one in three adults and costs the health care system approximately $76 billion a year. The launch of Pharmacy Advisor for chronic cardiovascular conditions follows recent research conducted by CVS Caremark, Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital that quantified for the first time how much can be saved per patient by improving medication adherence for common chronic diseases. The research, published this past January in the journal Health Affairs, found that patients with hypertension who took their medications as prescribed saved nearly $4,000 per year, patients with high cholesterol saved up to $1,200 per year and CHF patients saved nearly $8,000 annually. Through Pharmacy Advisor, CVS Caremark engages PBM members who are diagnosed with chronic conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, according to their expressed preferences at points when they are most receptive to messages about their prescribed therapy: face-to-face when members choose to fill prescriptions at CVS/pharmacy or by phone when members choose home delivery. The use of these integrated tactics drives behavior change in the short term and over time and leads to better clinical outcomes. In addition to improving medication adherence, thus saving money and improving the quality of treatment, the program closes gaps in care and directs members with chronic conditions to existing disease management programs where they can obtain additional support. The approach to Pharmacy Advisor is informed by CVS Caremark-sponsored research that has shown that counseling with a trusted health care professional is highly effective when it comes to improving medication adherence for patients with heart disease. In fact, pharmacists at retail drug stores were found to be the most influential voice in encouraging patients to take their medication as prescribed.",SEC Form 8k

For the quarter, the company reported net service revenue of $374,861,000 against $404,680,000 a year ago. Comparing third quarter results to the prior year, the company saw a decline in revenue of approximately $30 million, primarily as a result of the 2011 CMS rate cut of 5.2%, lower Home Health volumes, a reduction in the therapy needs of its patients and continued difficulties with the new therapy regulations. Operating loss was $557,317,000 against operating income of $37,085,000 a year ago. Loss before income taxes was $559,337,000 against income before income taxes of $35,751,000 a year ago. Net loss attributable to the company was $423,722,000 or $14.73 per basic and diluted share against net income attributable to the company of $21,634,000 or $0.76 per diluted share a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $27,780,000 against $47,174,000 a year ago. LBITDA was $547,367,000 against EBITDA of $46,489,000 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $29,446,000 against $51,895,000 a year ago. Adjusted net service revenue was $374,861,000 against $401,004,000 a year ago. Adjusted net income attributable to the company was $10,553,000 or $0.36 per diluted share against $25,465,000 or $0.89 per diluted share a year ago.

For the quarter, the company reported goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge of $574,114,000.

For the nine months, the company reported net service revenue of $1,112,885,000 against $1,239,996,000 a year ago. Operating loss was $491,826,000 against operating income of $155,096,000 a year ago. Loss before income taxes was $498,120,000 against income before income taxes of $149,157,000 a year ago. Net loss attributable to the company was $386,778,000 or $13.53 per basic and diluted share against net income attributable to the company of $90,482,000 or $3.18 per diluted share a year ago.

Adjusted net income attributable to the company was $47,988,000 or $1.65 per diluted share against $95,045,000 or $3.34 per diluted share a year ago.

For the fourth quarter 2011, the company estimates effective tax rate to be 40.5%. The company anticipates the reduction in non-billable therapy visits to continue into the fourth quarter 2011, thereby reducing the impact to revenue as it close out 2011.

For the year 2011, the company’s net service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.500 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.00 based on an estimated 29.3 million shares outstanding. This adjusted guidance excludes the effects of the non-cash impairment charge, any future acquisitions, if any are made, effects of any share repurchase, and non-recurring costs that may be incurred during the year or the impact of the final 2012 Medicare rate changes.

The company announced certain executive leadership changes and a strategic realignment of operating units to better address performance and position the company for long term success. Based on disappointing operating performance and looming 2012 cuts in Medicare reimbursement, the company reviewed portfolio of care centers for long term potential. This review has resulted in the identification of approximately 50 care centers targeted for closure, consolidation, or sale. The company is reorganizing divisional leadership to adjust to these portfolio changes and better align its operations for the future. As part of this reorganization, Mike D. Snow, the company's Chief Operating Officer, is departing to pursue other opportunities. The responsibilities for the company's operations formerly overseen by Mr. Snow will be assumed by William F. Borne, the company's Chief Executive Officer. Jim Robinson, the company's Executive Vice President of Operations, is leading both the home health and hospice business units and will now report directly to William F. Borne, Chief Executive Officer. The company announced that Ronald A. LaBorde has been appointed President. Mr. LaBorde has served on the company's board since 1997, serving as Lead Director since 2003. He will remain a member of the Board of Directors following his employment, at which time Donald Washburn will serve as the company's new Lead Director. In addition, the company announced that effective January 1, 2012, Dale Redman, current Chief Financial Officer, will transition to the role of Executive Vice President and Treasurer in anticipation of his planned retirement during the first quarter of 2012. Following this transition, it is intended that Mr. LaBorde will assume the additional role of Chief Financial Officer.",Business Wire
Oct-29-2011,Lawsuits & Legal Issues,"HCA Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)","Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Files Class Action Suit Against HCA Holdings, Inc","Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announced that a class action has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on behalf of purchasers of HCA Holdings, Inc. common stock pursuant or traceable to the Company's Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with its March 9, 2011 initial public offering. The complaint alleges that on or about March 11, 2011, HCA filed its prospectus for the IPO, which forms part of the Registration Statement and which became effective on March 9, 2011. At least 145.1 million shares of HCA common stock were sold to the public at $30 per share, raising $4.4 billion in gross proceeds for the Company and the selling shareholders. On July 25, 2011, the company issued a press release announcing disappointing second quarter 2011 financial results. On this news, the company's stock declined $6.64 per share to close at $27.97 per share on July 25, 2011, a one-day decline of nearly 20%. Then, on October 1, 2011, Barron's issued an article entitled ""Where Did the $15.8 Billion Go?"", which questioned HCA's accounting practices. According to the article, HCA improperly accounted for two major acquisitions as recapitalizations. In both instances, HCA should have accounted for the transaction as an acquisition using the purchase accounting method, but instead opted to use what is the functional equivalent of a pooling-of-interests method, which method was eliminated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 2001 in order to improve the quality of information provided to investors and users of financial statements. By using this prohibited method, HCA overstated its reported earnings, as the Company was able to avoid taking significant charges, including substantial depreciation and amortization charges, which would have negatively impacted its earnings. On this news, HCA's stock declined $1.35 per share to close at $18.81 per share on October 3, 2011, a one-day decline of nearly 7% and a nearly 38% decline from the stock's IPO price. According to the complaint, the true facts which were omitted from the Registration Statement were as follows: the Company improperly accounted for its prior business combinations in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, causing its financial results to be materially misstated; the company failed to maintain effective internal controls concerning its accounting for business combinations; and the company failed to disclose known trends and uncertainties as required by SEC regulations concerning its revenue growth rate. Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of HCA common stock issued in connection with its March 9, 2011 IPO. The plaintiff is represented by Robbins Geller, which has expertise in prosecuting investor class actions and extensive experience in actions involving financial fraud.",PR Newswire

Now, he's fighting back with a federal lawsuit against Walgreens, alleging wrongful termination. He filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids this week, the latest development in a case that has made headlines across the country and angered many, particularly those who support gun rights. Hoven said he had a right to act in self-defense and in defense of others. According to his lawsuit, he was working around 4:30 a.m. on May 8 when two masked gunmen entered the store on Benton Harbor's Napier Avenue. He started to call 911 when a gunman jumped the counter and pointed a handgun at him. Hoven observed the gunman's finger jerking on the gun's trigger as it was pointed at him and he (Hoven) immediately backed up and drew his concealed handgun. ""At that moment, Hoven reasonably and justifiably believed that he was going to be shot and either killed or seriously injured by the armed robber. Hoven then fired his handgun several times in self-defense and in defense of his co-workers. The robbers fled. One left a handgun behind. No workers or customers were hurt. Five days later, the lawsuit said, Hoven was told he could resign or be fired. Hoven was licensed to carry a firearm, having obtained a concealed-pistol license in 2008. Hoven, who is 36, began working full-time for Walgreens in 2006. He was working at the Napier Avenue store on December 5, 2007, when the store was robbed at gunpoint. Several customers fled to the back of the store, where the pharmacy is located, to escape the robbers. After the holdup, Hoven asked that a panic-button device be installed, and that the store close during power outages. Walgreens did not act on the requests. He then obtained the license to carry a concealed weapon and bought a Smith & Wesson handgun he kept in his pants pocket.",PR Newswire

While the new therapies offer improved response rates and a shorter treatment regimen for patients, they still result in uncomfortable and challenging side effects. The dedicated Hep C CareTeam educates patients about their disease and treatment regimen and supports them throughout therapy. The Team also researches and manages the benefits verification process, ensures on-time delivery of the medication, coordinates injection training for new patients and communicates proactively with the patient's physician. Hepatitis C is the most common blood borne viral infection in the United States. Current estimates suggest that approximately 3.2 million Americans may be infected with the virus, many of whom are unaware they have the disease because they do not experience any symptoms. Traditional therapies for the disease have low response rates and often have significant side effects (primarily flu-like symptoms) that cause the patient to feel worse during therapy and may contribute to non-adherence. In fact, only about 25% of patients who initiate therapy complete the full treatment regimen. The CVS Caremark Specialty Pharmacy Hep C CareTeam is comprised of nurses, pharmacists and pharmacy service representatives. These professionals are focused on the treatment of hepatitis C and undergo extensive, proprietary training and education related to the disease and available therapies. The Hep C CareTeam reinforces the physician's instructions to make sure the patient safely and effectively administers their prescribed medication and proactively communicates with the physician as needed to address any treatment related issues or complications that may arise.",Company Website

The settlement with Attorney General George Jepsen, comes 17 months after former Attorney General Richard Blumenthal filed suit against the drugstore chain. The outdated products included cough and allergy medicines, baby formula and antacids, energy drinks and milk, and eggs and yogurt, according to the lawsuit. Jepsen said more important than the $105,000 was the agreement by CVS to offer consumers a $2 discount coupon toward any purchase for each expired over-the-counter drug, baby food or formula, egg or dairy product that a consumer finds on store shelves and turns in to cashiers. Those coupons will be distributed for the next three years. Consumers do not have to make a purchase to receive the coupon and there is no limit on the number of coupons a consumer can receive. Investigators for Blumenthal found expired products at 20 of 45 Connecticut CVS stores visited in the spring and summer of 2009, among them stores in Avon, Berlin, Cheshire, Meriden, Newington, Old Saybrook and Rocky Hill. The suit asked for $5,000 for each deliberate violation of the law.

May-11-2010,Product-Related Announcements,CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE:CVS),CVS Caremark Corporation Launches Program to Help Pharmacy Benefit Management Clients Improve Diabetes Care,"CVS Caremark Corporation announced the launch of a new program aimed at strengthening pharmacy care for diabetes patients by improving member engagement through enhanced interactions with their pharmacists. The program is being offered to the company's pharmacy benefit management (PBM) clients for implementation in 2011 based on positive results from a recently completed pilot. In addition to achieving significant improvements in medication adherence rates and closing gaps in care, preliminary data also suggests the program can save employers on their health care benefit costs, with an estimated annual savings of nearly $600 per member with diabetes. In general, a client with 50,000 employees whose population has an average prevalence of diabetes could save approximately $3.3 million a year, or up to $6 million a year if there is a high prevalence of the disease. The six-month pilot of the Pharmacy Advisor(TM) program was conducted in partnership with a large global steel company in which participating members with diabetes achieved significant improvements in closing gaps in care and medication adherence rates. The pilot program used a multi-step process to identify and counsel members about gaps in care and adherence issues. Results demonstrated that this process closed a significantly higher number of gaps in care compared to a control group who were not counseled (58% and 90% higher for phone and face-to-face counseling, respectively). In addition, members receiving counseling were more likely to be adherent in every targeted medication class. The Pharmacy Advisor program integrates the benefits of the PBM and the retail pharmacy to improve pharmacy care. The program applies industry-leading health information technology to identify members who are being treated for diabetes and engages them with highly targeted counseling and support through the channels they choose. Member outreach includes educational information, pharmacist-initiated phone calls, or face-to-face counseling with a pharmacist at a local CVS/pharmacy. In addition, evidence-based protocols are applied to review the member's current treatment and determine if there are gaps in care or issues with medication adherence. Members are also presented with options and solutions to enable them to get the most out of their pharmacy benefit and identify opportunities for cost savings. The company plans to expand Pharmacy Advisor program offerings to include other chronic diseases and types of interventions in the near future.",Company Website

Apr-10-2010,Product-Related Announcements,CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE:CVS),CVS Caremark Corporation Presents Data of Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy,"CVS Caremark Corporation announced that it presented data at the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) that illustrate successful methods for improving adherence to medication and lowering prescription drug costs. The company showed results from three studies which demonstrated the positive impact of various tools available to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) - including automated telephonic messaging, fax alerts to physicians about gaps in care, and strategic co-pay waivers for generic medications. One of the CVS Caremark studies examined the effectiveness of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) programs in improving persistency to maintenance medication therapies dispensed via mail-service pharmacy. From October 2008 to February 2009, more than 94,000 commercially-insured mail pharmacy users received various combinations of supportive adherence messages delivered by IVR. Results showed that among members who answered the telephonic IVR, odds of refilling the prescription were up to 70.6% higher than controls. In addition, among members receiving early refill reminders the average first fill persistency rate (FFPR) at mail was 3.5% higher than controls, while the average FFPR was 1.4% higher than controls for members receiving refill reminders after their drug supply was exhausted. A second study examined the effectiveness of faxed alerts to physicians in resolving potential gaps in therapy in three areas: 1) adding an osteoporosis-preventative agent for women on long-term glucocorticosteroids; 2) adding an ACE inhibitor or ARB for adults with hypertension and diabetes; and 3) adding a lipid-lowering agent for individuals 30 years or older with diabetes. During the study period, a total of 337 employers and health plans, representing more than five million members, participated in a program that delivered fax alerts to providers when members' pharmacy claims indicated the absence of a recommended therapy in one of the areas outlined above. In this study, interventions were conducted between January 1 and March 30, 2009, with gap closure rates measured through September 30, 2009. Results showed that gap closure rates among members whose physician received a fax alert, were significantly higher than controls. For those members whose claims triggered an osteoporosis alert, gap closure rates were 8.4 percentage points higher than controls, those who triggered an anti-hypertensive therapy alert had gap closure rates 5.5 percentage points higher and those who triggered a cholesterol management alert had gap closure rates 4.5 percentage points higher. A third study examined the effectiveness of generic co-pay waiver programs designed to provide incentives for members using brand medications to switch to generics. Members using targeted brands were given a six-month period during which they could change to a recommended generic medication and receive generic co-pay waivers at mail. Members who converted to a generic early in the six-month period received two generic co-pay waivers (i.e. on medication for six months). Members who delayed their generic conversion until the end of the six-month period received one generic co-pay waiver (i.e. on medication for three months). The study focused on members who continued therapy with the generic after using the co-pay waiver(s) and found an overall higher sustained generic dispensing rate (GDR) for members who received two co-pay waivers (GDR of 88.2%) compared to members who received one co-pay waiver (GDR of 71.7%).",Thomson Reuters

The case is pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee (Civil Action No. 11-00601). A copy of the complaint may be obtained from Kaplan Fox or the Court. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants emphasized the company's positive financial performance and future business prospects, but failed to disclose or recklessly disregarded that the company's performance has been driven by the improper and undisclosed practice of systematically admitting patients into Community Health Systems' hospitals despite no clinical need. According to the Complaint, Community Health Systems artificially increased inpatient admissions for the purpose of receiving substantially higher and unwarranted payments from Medicare and other sources that wrongfully inflated its financial performance. The Complaint further alleges that the true facts, which were known by defendants but concealed from the investing public during the Class Period, were that (1) the company had for years engaged in the improper practice of systematically admitting patients into hospitals despite no clinical need, most notably by unnecessarily converting emergency-room visits into more lucrative inpatient admissions; (2) the Company's wrongful admissions procedures were designed to overbill Medicare and other sources for patient admissions; (3) as a result of the improper admissions and improper billing practices, the Company's reported revenues and earnings were materially and wrongfully inflated; and (4) based on the foregoing, defendants lacked a basis for their positive statements about the company's prospects and growth.",Business Wire

The company has taken this step in advance of even being served with Tenet's lawsuit.

Now that the offer is all cash, and the stock component has been eliminated, so has Tenet's pretext for alleging a securities law violation. For this reason alone, Tenet's claim must be dismissed. Tenet's lawsuit attacks the ethics and professional judgment of thousands of attending physicians at CHS affiliated hospitals which has no basis and is not material to the proxy contest concerning the election of Tenet's directors.

Managed Care Solutions Inc. of Hollywood, Fla., says that in 2003 it signed a three-year, exclusive agreement with Brentwood-based CHS to manage and collect payments for all of CHS' hospitals - 111 at that time. Managed Care Solutions collects money from patients whose accounts have an outstanding balance, usually when an insurance company refuses to reimburse a hospital for part or all of a bill. The company takes a cut of the amount it collects, 22% in CHS' case. But in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Florida, Managed Care Solutions claims CHS never provided the company with the necessary paperwork for 109 of the 111 hospitals. In the meantime, Managed Care Solutions says it spent more than $1.2 million implementing collections software in order to serve CHS's account. Managed Care Solutions says in the suit that CHS was ""attempting to find whatever way possible"" to terminate its agreement with the company. As proof, Managed Care Solutions points to a 2004 email sent by the chief financial officer at CHS' Pennsylvania hospital to corporate headquarters stating that ""we should find a way to terminate this contract and cease business relationships with MCS."" CHS did just that in February 2005 after learning that a Managed Care Solutions employee named Nichole Scott had been arrested for identity theft. In a letter to Managed Care Solutions included in court filings, CHS Senior Group Counsel Jennifer Peters said police said Nichole Scott used patients' confidential information at a New Jersey hospital to obtain credit cards and make purchases. Managed Care Solutions counters that Scott was never employed its company and actually worked for a third-party staffing firm called Kforce Inc., which Managed Care Solutions contracted to perform claim services on CHS' behalf. Furthermore, Managed Care Solutions says it has no proof that Scott was ever arrested, much less that she stole patients' information. The company also says that there was no reason that Scott should have had access to that type of information, unless CHS provided it.",GlobeNewswire
